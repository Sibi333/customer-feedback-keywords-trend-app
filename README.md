# customer-feedback-keywords-trend-app
This analysis is done to track and monitor the keywords trend from customer feedback. Frequency analysis and clustering is done in order to find out the most frequent words and also the associated words. 
For example: If 'shipping cost' is the keyword to be tracked also the related words such as 'shipping fee', 'delivery cost' and so on must be taken into account as customer could mention whichever way possible. Also business relevant keywords are included. 

Then logic is created to track the trend of these keywords using RShiny web application. Also there is an option to select the required keywords and view the relevant feedback. 

Please note: Data, results and other confidential information aren't shared explicitly due to privacy reasons. This is only to showcase the approach towards analysis.  

This work is done using R, RShiny in RStudio.
